when send our project to roduction we saw only one js file.if have a large scale project then it will take a lot of time time to loading the page .so we need to use Lazy Loading using this we can split our code in chunks .and for different file we can create multiple js file . 

using Lazy Loading we can create different bundle for different file .
if we add Lazy Loading to a component then the component will not load until we not opent that component.
it is also known as on demand loading
